				<h1>UNL Data Breaches</h1>
        <p>Like any large institution that stores tremendous amounts of data, the University of Nebraska, Lincoln has been the target of a number of cyber attacks over the years. Although the university has many robust and sophisticated security measures in place, data breaches are inevitable. Two recent attacks that resulted in a large loss of data were the unauthorized access to the server that contained the results of the math placement exam uncovered in 2016, and the data breach of the Nebraska Student Information System in 2012. <a href="references.html">In a recent interview</a>, Rick Haugerud, Assistant Vice President of Information Technology Services at UNL discussed a couple major events that UNL has faced in recent years.</p>

        <h2>Math Placement Exam Breach, 2016</h2>
        <p>In 2016, <a href="https://news.unl.edu/topic-tags/math-placement-test-server-breach/">UNL announced</a> that ITS had uncovered unauthorised access to the servers that contain the Math Placement Exam results. Further investigation found that an unauthorised party gained access two years prior to its discovery, so any student that took the math placement exam between 2014 and 2016 is in jeopardy of their data being compromised.</p>
        <p>According to <a href="https://www.ketv.com/article/unl-security-breach-puts-thousands-of-current-former-students-information-at-risk/8522433">KETV</a>, over 30,000 students were affected by the data breach over the two years of access. UNL reported that only a single server was breached. The server in question contained no sensitive information only storing the names of participants, along with the correlating NUIDs, and grades on the placement exam.</p>
        <p>Following the discovery of the breach, students were notified via email by a letter from Joseph Francisco, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and Mark Askren, Vice Chancellor for Information Technology and CIO for UNL. The notification was sent out within a week of the breach being uncovered as regulated by FERPA.</p>

        <h2>Nebraska Student Information System Breach, 2012</h2>
        <p>During his interview, Haugerud noted that the only other large data breach during his appointment in 2009 was the 2012 Nebraska Student Information System breach. Haugerud described that one morning, an administrator noted activity in accounts that were not supposed to be active. Further investigation revealed that a UNL computer science student was behind the attack and no sensitive information was stolen. The system in question contained thousands of social security numbers of current and former students, but the security measures in place only exposed a couple hundred of those to the hacker.</p>
        <p>Following the attach, UNL immediately reported the incident to the Department of Education. The DoE completed a full investigation to ensure that the attack was not related to other attacks occurring across the nation at the time. Additionally, the parent company of the NSIS software, PeopleSoft, met with university representatives to complete software updates that would ensure that no incident of this caliber could occur again.</p>
