				<h1>Privacy at UNL ITS</h1>
        
        <p>Information Technology Services (ITS) at UNL was founded in 1995 to offer a “single information technology support group for UNL - coordinating and supporting the needs of Teaching, Research, Outreach, and Administration.” Though the role of ITS has changed over the years as technology has evolved, ITS now offers over 100 <a href="https://its.unl.edu/services/">services</a> to UNL students, faculty, and staff ranging from document storage to event management systems to video conferencing. This list of services also includes systems like Canvas (student management), Office 365 e-mail, Firefly (employee management), MyRED (used for enrollment in classes and paying tuition bills), and many other systems that house copious amounts of student data. In addition, ITS is responsible for training UNL faculty about best practices regarding information security.</p>
        
        <h2>How does UNL ITS try to protect student privacy?</h2>
        <p>ITS monitors network traffic to find instances of unencrypted personal information like credit card numbers being transmitted to websites that are not secure. If ITS notices this happening, they will notify the students affected and let them know that their information may have been compromised. Depending on the organization, UNL ITS may even reach out to the administrators of the website to provide assistance in making their platform more secure.</p>
        <p>To protect its own systems, UNL ITS is part of several Information Sharing and Analysis Centers, or <a href="https://www.nationalisacs.org/">ISACs</a>. ISACs are groups of organizations that will share information about cybersecurity threats so that every member of the ISAC can protect themselves.</p>
        <p>ITS also works to keep personally identifiable information of UNL students private by setting <a href="https://its.unl.edu/security/minimum-security-standards/">minimum security standards</a> for applications owned by other departments. ITS conducts code and security reviews of every application that has access to student information and requires that access requests for data be renewed every year to limit student data usage to the situations in which it is necessary.</p>
      
        <h2>What resources are available from ITS for students to protect themselves?</h2>
        <p>ITS has several resources to help students protect their data and their devices from unwanted access:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://its.unl.edu/security/phishingunl/"><strong>Phishing</strong></a>
            <p>There is information about what phishing is, how to spot phishing attacks, a list of recent phishing attack e-mails, and steps to take if you are a victim of phishing. There is even an e-mail list run by ITS to help students stay vigilant about phishing.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://its.unl.edu/security/creating-curiously-strong-passwords/"><strong>Passwords</strong></a>
            <p>There is information about the importance of strong passwords and methods for generating passwords that are easy to remember but hard to break. ITS even created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQzRl800q5U&feature=youtu.be">video</a> to share the importance of proper password management.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://its.unl.edu/security/security-incident-reporting-form/"><strong>Incident Reporting</strong></a>
            <p>ITS has set up a place for students to submit any breach in security that they believe has occurred. Reporters are asked to classify incidents by severity, category, and provide information about any data that may have been involved in the breach.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://its.unl.edu/services/antivirus/"><strong>Antivirus</strong></a>
            <p>UNL offers free antivirus to students to protect them from attacks that may breach their data.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://its.unl.edu/services/duo/"><strong>Two-Factor Authentication</strong></a>
            <p>Students can request to enroll in two-factor authentication to protect the security of their devices and prevent access to their data from outside sources. This is a new service provided by ITS, though they hope to be near 100% enrollment in the next 18 months.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
