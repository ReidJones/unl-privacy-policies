				<h1>HIPAA and Health Data</h1>
				<p>Grades are not the only facet of student privacy issues. UNL, like many schools across the nation, collects and stores health data from students when they enroll, and every time they use services like the University Health Center. This data is subject to strict privacy standards under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. </p>
				<h2>What information does UNL collect?</h2>
				<p>Before a student is allowed to enroll in classes at UNL, they must provide immunization records to prove they have received the vaccine for meningitis and two separate injections of the MMR vaccine which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella. This information is uploaded to MyRED, the centralized University of Nebraska student management system. A report containing the students’ name, NUID number, birthdate, and immunization records can be downloaded from MyRED at any time.</p>
				<p>UNL’s Health Center, a clinic run by Nebraska Medicine and the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), also collects and stores a significant amount of student health data. When students visit the health center, in addition to the usual amount of personal and family health data, are asked to provide their NUID number to prove that they are a student at the Univerisity of Nebraska. Also, all patients are automatically signed up for OneChart, a third-party system that stores a history of medications, appointments, and personal information (like birthdays). </p>
				<h2>How is student health information used?</h2>
				<p>On its website, UNMC has posted a “Notice of Privacy Practices” explaining how medical information about its patients may be used. Notably, this information includes an explanation of its responsibilities to patients and a list of circumstances in which UNMC may disclose information about patients without their written consent. UNMC is required to “maintain the privacy of your health information during your lifetime and for 50 years following your death” and notify patients “following a breach of unsecured protected health information in the event you are affected.” UNMC is also required to obtain patient consent before sharing health information, except in the cases specifically stated in their privacy policy as not requiring consent. At present, this includes using patient data for fundraising, releasing information at the request of law enforcement, to communicate with a patient’s family about their condition, and many others. UNMC also reserves the right to use patient data as part of teaching medical students and other research projects as approved by its Institutional Review Board. </p>
				<h2>What has UNL done to make health data more secure and maintain student privacy? What is left to be done?</h2>
				<p>UNL students are now no longer able to bill health center visits to their student accounts, removing one link between the two entities that, if exploited, could breach significant amounts of personally identifiable information. However, an inherent link exists because of the need for patients of the Health Center to prove that they are also students at the University of Nebraska. The NUID provided to the Health Center at each appointment, if tied to information in other UNL systems, could paint a complete picture of a students’ health, education, and financial situation.</p> 
				<p>Recently, MyRED, along with several other UNL systems, has been upgraded to require dual-factor authentication. This is an improvement in security that will help ensure medical data is not breached.</p>
