				<h1>UNL FERPA Implementations</h1>
        
        <p>The most commonly known student privacy legislation is the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The University of Nebraska- Lincoln, like every other educational institution, must abide by the privacy guidelines set by FERPA. According to <a href="https://ferpa.unl.edu/">>UNL’s FERPA website</a>, the law’s primary assertion is that a student is the owner of their academic record. It outlines what types of information may and may not be public and states that the student controls who has access to this information. It also requires that students have the right to access these records. All universities are required to follow FERPA.</p>
        <p>At UNL, FERPA is implemented and enforced by the University Registrar. Any questions or concerns about UNL’s compliance with FERPA should be directed to the <a href="https://registrar.unl.edu/">Office of the Registrar</a>. <a href="references.html">In a recent interview</a> the current University Registrar, Steven Booton, outlined how UNL strives to be in compliance. The process begins with training various departments. Booton described that departments can request a presentation on FERPA requirements at any point during the school year. This varies from only heads of departments that then disseminate the information to everyone else to having the entire department attend. In addition to presenting the information, any university official who has access to systems that contain FERPA protected information must sign an agreement that outlines student data protections.</p>
        <p>Booton also discussed how UNL and other institutions are audited for FERPA compliance. UNL gets audited by multiple different institutions. The most intensive audit is conducted by the federal government. These audits occur around every two years and investigations take several months. These investigations dig deep into how UNL stores and secures student data. Auditors also look into security and transactions of access to the data. In addition to federal audits, Booton described that state governments also audit FERPA compliance but with greater frequency. State audits typically focus on auditing the financial systems that store student information and happen every couple of months. Interestingly, there are no internal practices in place to audit departments at the university.</p>
        <p>Booton also spent a portion of the interview discussing FERPA violations. If a FERPA violation or breach were to occur, the response varies greatly by the type of  data obtained. In the cases of <a href="data-breaches.html">massive data breaches</a>, FERPA outlines that all students must be notified within a certain time period. The breach is then also reported at the federal level. In the instance that a university official, such as a professor or teaching assistant, reveals student information to an inappropriate third party, this typically results in further training with no reporting needed. The registrar’s office will follow up with these individuals on a case by case basis when the need arises. There is no formal means to report FERPA violations by university officials.</p>
        <p>According to Booton, technology has significantly changed the atmosphere of student protection and FERPA. Before information was stored in the cloud, the only security measure to consider was properly locking student records. Now the conversation becomes much more complicated. Technology has also brought about a number of <a href="software-vendors.html">third party vendors</a> that greatly enhance students’ educational experiences, but also further expose FERPA protected data. FERPA contains guidelines for data storage and use requirements for vendors.</p>
