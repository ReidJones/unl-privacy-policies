				<h1>Accountability</h1>
				
        <p>Online privacy has become one of the most fiercely debated topics in recent years. While most of the discussion has focused on the large tech giants such as Facebook and Google, universities and other educational institutions are becoming a larger part of the public discussion on data privacy and online security.</p>

        <h2>Recent university data breaches</h2>
        <p>The increased discussion comes from a string of data breaches targeting universities across the country. In 2014 the University of Maryland, Butler University, and the University of wisconsin-Parkside were among several institutions involved in <a href="https://www.databreachtoday.asia/universities-prime-breach-targets-a-7865">data breaches exposing student data</a>. In February 2019 <a href="https://www.securityinfowatch.com/cybersecurity/information-security/breach-detection/news/21068904/personal-information-of-students-exposed-in-stanford-data-breach">Stanford was hit with its second data breach</a> in 15 months, exposing personal information including home addresses, Social Security numbers, test scores, essays. As more and more universities fall victim to data breaches it is important that they are held accountable and responsible for the breaches.</p>

        <h2>Privacy watchdog organization</h2>
        <p>Watchdog organizations like the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) are dedicated to monitoring education institutions and reporting when student’s rights are violated. In 2014 <a href="https://www.studentprivacymatters.org/about-us/">Leonie Haimson and Rachael Stickland created a watchdog organization</a> called the Parent Coalition for Student Privacy (PCSP). The PCSP is specifically focused on advocating for student privacy rights. One of PCSP’s most notable pushes for student privacy is its privacy report card. Every year the organization gives each state a letter grade to represent the state’s commitment to student privacy. In 2019 PCSP gave 27 states a failing grade—D+ or lower—and the highest grade given was a B. Nebraska was listed as one of the failing states with a D+. While they primarily focus on K-12 education, PCSP is a prime example of a grassroots movement for holding educational institutions accountable.</p>

        <h2>Student privacy laws</h2>
        <p>While watchdog organizations are important to raise awareness of student privacy issues, federal laws are critical to ensuring student privacy laws is upheld in U.S. educational institutions. As discussed in other articles on this site, FERPA is a key piece of student privacy legislation that grants the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) various methods of enforcing student privacy standards. While the Family Policy Compliance Office (FPCO) of the DOE is responsible for enforcing FERPA, <a href="http://ferpaguide.org/?page_id=51">they have never actually withheld funds</a> from an educational institution as a result of FERPA violations. Instead the FPCO usually works with the offending institution to remedy the violation and achieve voluntary compliance. The last major enforcement of FERPA occurred in 2000 in the court case U.S. v. Miami University in the United State Court of Appeals.</p>

        <h2>Ethical arguments about student privacy</h2>
        <p>Holding educational institutional accountable for a student’s privacy is also desirable under several ethical frameworks. From a deontological perspective it’s clear that if we assume student privacy is inherently good then any action that would infringe on that privacy would be unethical. However, under a utilitarian ethical framework student privacy is morally opaque. This would require comparing the total happiness students receive from their privacy against the total happiness generated by the use of student data to create a better learning experience.</p>
