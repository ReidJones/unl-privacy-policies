			<h1>FERPA in K-12 vs. Post-Secondary Education</h1>
			
			<h2>What is FERPA and what does it protect?</h2>
			<p>Passed in 1974, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) was intended to maintain the confidentiality of student educational records. The legislation was an amendment to a bill expanding on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Interestingly enough, there were no legislative committee studies or public testimonies given before this legislation was passed. Senator James Buckley of New York, the primary sponsor of the amendment, cited “the growing evidence of the abuse of student records across the nation.”</p>
			<p>FERPA gives students many rights, including the right to see their own education records, request corrections to those records, stop the school from releasing personally identifiable information, and get a copy of the school’s policy concerning the privacy of education records. Further, FERPA prevents schools from releasing education records without the written consent of the student (or in the case where a student is a minor, the student’s parents). </p>
			<p>However, while FERPA is meant to protect the privacy of students, it does not prevent the use of educational records for several legitimate purposes. There are many exceptions that allow the release of education records without consent from the student. For example, a student’s records can be given, without consent, to school officials with a “legitimate educational interest”, to other schools a student wants to enroll in, accrediting organizations, financial aid offices, groups conducting studies for a school, in case of a health or safety emergency, to the authorities in the juvenile justice system, and many more. FERPA also contains provisions for schools to use third-party systems (like Canvas) to hold student data. </p>
			<p>FERPA pertains to all schools (public or private) and state or local education agencies that receive federal funds. It has been upheld in courts that FERPA does not create any enforceable rights, meaning that students may not file a lawsuit against their school for violations of FERPA. Instead, FERPA violations are reported to the Department of Education’s Family Policy Compliance Office which can withhold federal funds from schools which fail to comply with the rules.</p>
			
			<h1>Differences for Post-Secondary Students</h1>
			<p>FERPA differentiates post-secondary students from K-12 students in a few ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>First, there are some limits on the education records that post-secondary students are allowed to review. When FERPA was first passed, many schools were concerned because the new rules would theoretically allow students to view confidential letters of recommendation since those would be considered education records under FERPA. The first amendment to FERPA included provisions to prevent students from seeing such letters, and also blocked them from seeing their parents’ financial records.</li>
				<li>Second, post-secondary students are afforded less strict protection under FERPA than K-12 students. If a post-secondary student under the age of 21 violates a law or school rule related to alcohol or drugs, the school can notify the student’s parents without consent. Further, the results of disciplinary proceedings related to violence and some sex offenses can be released to the victim of said crime. These exceptions are in addition to the same exceptions made for younger students.</li>
			</ul>
			<blockquote class="blockquote">Post-secondary students are afforded less strict protection under FERPA than K-12 students.</blockquote>
			<p>These differences mean that the administrators of post-secondary education institutions have more discretion and power to make decisions about student privacy. This presents several questions about who is setting policy, how policies are enforced, and who is keeping universities accountable for maintaining student privacy.</p>
